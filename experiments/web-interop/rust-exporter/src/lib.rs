//! PR-6 experiment: the Rust (Host) side of a two-module WebAssembly link.
//!
//! This crate plays the role the `dioxus-compose` Host would play on the Web
//! target. It owns a fixed-layout arena in linear memory (PR-4) and exports the
//! boundary functions the Renderer module is supposed to import directly,
//! without a JavaScript frame on the call path.
//!
//! Two artifacts are built from this one source (see `build.sh`):
//!   * `host_owns_memory.wasm`  - the module defines and exports `memory`.
//!   * `host_imports_memory.wasm` - built with `-Clink-arg=--import-memory`, so
//!     the module imports `env.memory` instead. This is the variant needed if
//!     the *other* module turns out to be the only one able to own the memory.
