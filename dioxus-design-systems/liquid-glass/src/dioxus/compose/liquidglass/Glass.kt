 * optional: for a reader with low vision, text over a moving translucent backdrop is the
 * difference between a usable screen and an unusable one. When this is true every glass
 * surface draws its opaque fallback instead, and the fallback is the colour whose
 * contrast was guaranteed when the material was built.
 *
 * The renderer that hosts this library is responsible for reading the platform setting
 * and providing it. It defaults to false rather than throwing, because a design system
 * that refuses to draw when nobody wired up an accessibility query is worse than one that
 * draws the unreduced form.

 *   to its background instead of being a fixed colour.
 * - Glass, reduced: the stored opaque fallback, which was built to meet contrast against
 *   the content colour. The lit edge stays, because it is geometry rather than
 *   transparency and removing it would flatten the surface for no accessibility gain.
 * - Opaque: a flat fill, which is not a degraded anything. It is what Material 3, Fluent
 *   and the Linux systems actually look like.
 *
 * The blur that belongs to this material is not applied here. Compose blurs an element's
 * own content, never what is behind it, so a surface cannot blur its own backdrop; the
 * backdrop layer has to do it. See [glassBackdrop].
