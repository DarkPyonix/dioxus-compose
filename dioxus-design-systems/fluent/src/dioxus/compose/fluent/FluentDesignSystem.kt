/**
 * Fluent 2, written from Microsoft's specification.
 *
 * There is no Compose implementation of Fluent from Microsoft to delegate to, so unlike
 * the Material system in this project, this one resolves every role itself from the
 * published Fluent 2 token set. Konyaco/compose-fluent-ui is a readable cross check for
 * the same values and is deliberately not a dependency: it describes its own API as
 * experimental and subject to change without notice, and every dependency added here is
 * another surface that has to stay reachable under GraalVM native image.
 *
 * What makes the result read as Fluent rather than as Material with different colours:
 * tight 4dp corners on controls instead of large or pill shapes, a lighter stroke along
 * the top edge of anything raised so it reads as a slab lit from above, layered shadows
 * rather than a tinted surface, and Accent, Standard and Subtle button weights in place
 * of Material's filled and tonal pair. No ripple anywhere: Fluent changes a control's
 * fill on press, it does not spread a wave from the pointer.
 *
 * Light and dark are two instances because Fluent changes more than lightness between
 * them. Its accent moves up the brand ramp and the foreground on the accent flips to
 * near black, its top stroke goes from a faint white line to a pronounced one, and its
 * shadows deepen.
