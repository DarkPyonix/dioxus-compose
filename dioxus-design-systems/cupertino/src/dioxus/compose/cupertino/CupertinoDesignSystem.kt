/**
 * Apple's design language, as of macOS 26 and iOS 26.
 *
 * Four things separate this from the other systems here, and none of them is a colour
 * choice.
 *
 * Corners are continuous rather than circular, so the curvature rises out of the straight
 * edge instead of starting abruptly at a tangent point. An element nested inside a
 * container gets a radius cut for that container rather than a radius of its own, which
 * is why the corner ladder is only half the story and [dioxus.compose.liquidglass.inset]
 * is the other half.
 *
 * Surfaces are a material, not a fill. A card here answers with
 * [SurfaceMaterial.Glass]: translucent, edge lit along the top and shaded along the
 * bottom, with the app content underneath showing through blurred. The limit is worth
 * stating rather than glossing: Compose cannot sample what is behind the window, so the
 * glass reflects what this application drew and nothing else. That is the honest extent
 * of it, and it is most of what makes a screen read as iOS 26.
 *
 * Pressing dims. There is no ripple anywhere in this system, which is why
 * [ButtonStyle.ripple] exists as a value the design system answers rather than as
 * something a widget decides.
 *
 * Raising a surface casts a wide soft shadow and changes nothing else. Apple never tints
 * a raised surface the way Material does, and never draws Fluent's lit hairline along the
 * top of a card; the lit edge belongs to the glass material, where it is a rim all the way
 * round rather than a line across the top.
