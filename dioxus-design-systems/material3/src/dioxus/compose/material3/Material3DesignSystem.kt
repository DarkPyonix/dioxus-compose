/**
 * Material 3, resolved by delegating to androidx.compose.material3.
 *
 * Every value here comes out of a real [ColorScheme], [Typography] and [Shapes]. Nothing
 * is redrawn from foundation primitives: a hand written Material button is always a worse
 * Material button, and ripple, state layers, motion and accessibility semantics come free
 * from the library. Where this file does arithmetic (the elevation tint, the pressed state
 * layer) it is reproducing a documented Material rule over colours the caller supplied,
 * not inventing a look.
 *
 * Light and dark are two instances ([Light] and [Dark]) rather than one instance with a
 * flag, so a caller holding a design system never has to also carry the scheme it belongs
 * to.
