#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Usage: ./dioxus-compose-renderer/scripts/gate-platforms.sh <build|test>
#
# Prints, one per line, the platforms this machine can build, or can run tests for. Used by
# scripts/check.sh so that the Kotlin gate runs everywhere rather than only on a machine
# with every SDK and a phone plugged into it.
#
# The list starts from the project's own modules, so a platform added later is covered
# without anyone remembering to add it here. Only the reasons to leave one out are written
# down, and each one is a thing this machine has not got rather than a thing we do not
# want built:
#
#   linuxX64   the window reaches Xlib, the sync extension and GLX through cinterop, and
#              cinterop compiles against the real headers rather than a copy of them. One
#              package manager line on Linux; XQuartz on macOS, which is a download.
#   android    the tests are instrumented, so they need a device or an emulator. Building
#              needs neither, so it is only left out of the test run.
#   iosArm64   a device target has no test task at all, and naming one that has none is an
#              error rather than a skip.
#   iosSimulatorArm64
#              the tests run in a simulator, so there has to be one installed. Building
#              needs none, so this too is only left out of the test run. A machine with no
#              simulators is what this was written for: the failure it gives is an internal
#              error reading `No available device`, thrown after every other platform's
#              tests have already passed, which reads as the gate breaking rather than as
#              something not installed.
