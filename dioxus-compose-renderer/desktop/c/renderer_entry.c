 * resize border, Snap Layouts and the animation when the window is restored. None of
 * those can be drawn from inside the window, and an application that gives them up looks
 * worse than one that kept the system bar. The first person to run this said the borders
 * looked crude, and they were.
 *
 * What VS Code and Windows Terminal do instead is keep every one of those and take only
 * the caption. A window reports its client area in WM_NCCALCSIZE. Letting the default
 * handler compute the frame and then putting the top edge back where it started leaves
 * the sides and the bottom as the system's while the strip the caption occupied becomes
 * ours to draw in. The styles are untouched, so the shadow, the border and Snap are
 * untouched with them.
 *
 * Two details are not optional. A maximised window is deliberately laid out larger than
 * the monitor by the border thickness, so the same edges fall off screen; restoring the
 * top edge unchanged there puts the caption off screen too, and it has to be inset. And
 * the top resize band lived in the non-client area that no longer exists, so the hit test
 * has to answer for it or the window becomes the one window on the desktop that cannot be
 * resized from the top.
 *
 * The geometry below is duplicated in Kotlin, which draws into the same strip.

 *
 * So it is asked for here, through the Objective-C runtime, in the same file and the same
 * spirit as the Windows window procedure a few hundred lines up. What may not be written
 * by hand is the shim between the Host and the Renderer, which is generated; the renderer
 * talking to its own window is not that.
 *

 * style, so the style mask is the message: a window that kept the ordinary title bar
