// A window of our own on Windows, with a Direct3D 12 swapchain in it and no toolkit
// between.
//
// The pair of `appkit_window.m`. The renderer draws with Skia into a swapchain buffer;
// everything between that buffer and the screen belongs to Win32 and DXGI, and this file
// is what talks to them: a window class, a window, an adapter, a device, a queue and a
// swapchain. What the toolkit was doing here was translating the same few things into
// Java and back, and each translation has been somewhere a frame went wrong.
//
// Nothing here draws. The pixels are Skia's, as they already were.
//
// The same native symbols the macOS file exports, because the Kotlin side reaches them by
// name and only one of the two files is ever compiled into an image. What the five
// pointers in `struct dxc_native_window` mean is this platform's business; what
// `struct dxc_event` looks like is not, and it is declared here field for field as the
// macOS file declares it so that one piece of Kotlin can read either.
//
// Two of the four walls the macOS window ran into are not here. A window may be created
// on any thread on Windows, and the thread that created it is the thread its messages are
// delivered to, so there is no main-thread hop: the renderer opens its own window on the
// thread it draws from. Nor is there a view that hands out a drawable only inside its own
// callback; a swapchain answers whenever it is asked. The other two walls stand. Skia's
// recording is not its submission, and a word value lives only in straight-line code, and
// both of those are the Kotlin side's to keep.

// Windows 10, because the per-monitor DPI calls below arrived with it and a window that
// asks the monitor how big a point is was the whole reason for asking.
