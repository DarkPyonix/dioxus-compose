// the screen is AppKit's, and AppKit is what this file talks to: a window, a view, a
// layer, a device and a queue. What the toolkit was doing here was translating the same
// few things into Java and back, and each translation has been somewhere a frame went
// wrong: a window that insists it is opaque, a peer rebuilt under a surface, a title bar
// belonging to a class we cannot reach.
//
// Nothing here draws. The pixels are Skia's, as they already were.
//
// A layer rather than an MTKView. A view of that kind vends its drawable inside its own
// drawing callback and answers nil outside it, so a renderer that decides for itself when
// a frame happens gets a window that stays black. The layer hands one over whenever it is
// asked, which is the arrangement the frame clock already assumes.
