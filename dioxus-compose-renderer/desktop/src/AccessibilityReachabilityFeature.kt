/**
 * Registers the AWT accessibility bridge for the image (SPEC NFR-8, §7, INTENT D9-macOS).
 *
 * VoiceOver reaches a Compose window through AWT. Compose asks Skiko to attach the window's
 * `Accessible` to the platform, Skiko's native `initializeCAccessible` looks up
 * `sun.lwawt.macosx.CAccessible` through JNI, and from then on AppKit drives the whole tree
 * from Objective-C: for each element it calls back into `CAccessibility` to ask for the
 * children, the role, the name and the value.
 *
 * This Feature removes one proven gap on that path and does not yet make it work.
 *
 * The proven part is the resource bundle. Asked for a child's role,
 * `CAccessibility.getAccessibleRole` calls `AccessibleRole.toString`, which resolves the
 * role's display name through the bundle below. A resource bundle is not reachable unless
 * it is registered, so on an image without it the lookup raised
 * `MissingResourceRegistrationError` from inside `getAccessibleRole`. Registering the
 * bundle makes that error go away, which was confirmed by building with
 * `--exact-reachability-metadata -R:MissingRegistrationReportingMode=Warn` and watching it
 * disappear from the run.
 *
 * The classes are registered on the same grounds as the input method path: the platform
 * enters them from Objective-C rather than from Java, so the closed-world analysis has no
 * reason to keep their members. That registration is not known to be either necessary or
 * sufficient here, because no tool reported it missing. The `sun.lwawt.macosx` half is
 * already covered by [ImeReachabilityFeature], which takes that package whole.
 *
 * Registration alone was not enough: the role classes are reached only by name from
 * Objective-C, so the linker dropped 26 of them and the build script now roots them with
 * `-Wl,-u`. See `experiments/accessibility/README.md` for the evidence.
