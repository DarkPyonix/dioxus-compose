/**
 * The Compose key a platform key number means.
 *
 * A table because the two numberings have nothing to do with each other: the platform
 * numbers keys by where they sit on the board, and Compose names them by what they are.
 * Only the keys that have a meaning of their own are here. A key that types a character
 * carries that character in the event beside it, and a screen reading text wants the
 * character rather than the position.
 *
 * Unknown is a real answer for a key that only types something. What reaches the scene
 * carries no character on purpose, because the input method is putting the text in and
 * sending it here as well types every letter twice; so a key that is only a letter has
 * nothing to do here and Unknown is what it should be.
 *
 * A letter held with a modifier is not that. Then it is a shortcut, and a shortcut is
 * matched by which key it is: with the letters missing from this table, every one of them
 * arrived as Unknown and Compose's own editing shortcuts were dead. Copy, cut, paste,
 * select all, undo and redo are the ones anyone notices, and none of them worked.
