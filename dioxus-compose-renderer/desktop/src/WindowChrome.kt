/**
 * Modern window decoration, which is what every desktop platform now expects.
 *
 * macOS moved the title bar into the application's own content years ago, GNOME draws
 * client side decorations, and Windows 11 applications generally paint their own caption.
 * A window with a separate system title bar looks a decade old on all three.
 *
 * The platforms want genuinely different things, so this does not invent a common
 * abstraction over them:
 *
 * - macOS keeps its real title bar but makes it transparent and lets content run
 *   underneath. The close, minimise and zoom buttons stay the system's. Drawing those
 *   ourselves would be the most visible way to fail at looking native: their placement,
 *   hover behaviour, full screen transition and accessibility labels all belong to the
 *   system, and an imitation drifts from the real thing on the next OS release.
 * - Windows and Linux get an undecorated window and we paint the caption, because neither
 *   offers an equivalent of the macOS client properties through AWT.
