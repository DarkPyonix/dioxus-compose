// A window that is ours, drawn into with Skia and with no toolkit in between.
//
// Beside `NativeHostConnection` rather than among the renderer's own files, and for the
// same reason: this is the only other place that names GraalVM types, so a development
// run on a JVM never loads them.
//
// The C side is `c/appkit_window.m`. It owns the window, the view, the layer, the Metal
// device and the queue, and answers with the pointers. Nothing there draws.
//
// The scene this drives is Compose's own, reached through an interface the library marks
// as being for its own modules. There is no other way in: the supported entry builds a
// toolkit window, and a toolkit window is the thing being removed. Kept to this one file
// and pinned to the version in the module file, which is what the rule about unstable
// APIs asks for. A Compose upgrade changes this file or it changes nothing.
