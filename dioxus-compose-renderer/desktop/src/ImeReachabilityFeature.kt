/**
 * Registers the AWT text input path for the image (SPEC §6, INTENT D9-macOS).
 *
 * The platform calls into Java through JNI to drive an input method: it asks which character
 * a point maps to, where the caret is, what the composed text is. Those Java methods are
 * private and reached only from Objective-C, so the closed-world analysis cannot see them.
 * Missing one does not fail the build; it aborts the process as an Objective-C exception the
 * first time an IME touches a text field, which is how this was found.
 *
 * Listing methods by hand is the wrong shape of solution: the list is long, it is invisible
 * to the compiler, and it silently rots when the JDK changes. This registers whole packages
 * instead, letting the image carry a little more than it strictly needs. See
 * [ReachabilityRegistration] for how members are registered and why native methods are skipped.
