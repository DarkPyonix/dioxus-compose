/**
 * What a platform key number means to Compose.
 *
 * The letters are here because of what they mean when a modifier is held. A letter on its
 * own types something and the input method puts that text in, so the scene wants nothing
 * from it; a letter held with Command is a shortcut, and a shortcut is matched by which
 * key it is. With the letters missing every one of them arrived as `Unknown`, so copy,
 * cut, paste, select all, undo and redo were all dead in every field this renderer draws.
