/**
 * Draws a real sample's screen, once per design system and once per window width, and
 * writes a PNG beside the recording it came from.
 *
 * The showcase next door is a script of primitives written to exercise the token tables.
 * A sample is an application laid out the way someone would really lay one out, and that
 * is where a token turns out to be wrong in a way no ladder of swatches shows: a readout
 * whose fill matches the page behind it is drawn full size, in the right colour, and
 * cannot be seen. Six systems that nobody has looked at under a real screen is six
 * chances at that, and three widths each is where a layout that is right on a phone and
 * broken on a desktop stops hiding.
 *
 * The frames are the bytes the Host encoded, written by the samples' own `DXC_FRAME_DIR`
 * runs, so what gets drawn here is what an application would send and not a Kotlin
 * restatement of it. A screen can take more than one batch to build, a list holds no rows
 * until something asks for a window, so a file is a sequence of batches, each behind four
 * little endian bytes of its length.
 *
 * The window is not chosen here. The Host laid the screen out for a particular size and
 * said so in the file's name, so drawing it at any other size would photograph a layout
 * that never existed. Density is pinned at one, so a dp in the name is a pixel in the
 * picture.
 *
 * Enabled only when `DXC_FRAME_DIR` names a directory holding those recordings, because it
 * reads and writes files.
