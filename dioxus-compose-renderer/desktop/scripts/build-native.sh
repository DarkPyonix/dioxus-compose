# Heap and GC settings, in service of the desktop memory target (an empty window under
# 56MB of physical footprint). `-R:` options are baked in as the image's runtime defaults. Measure with desktop/scripts/measure-memory.sh.
#
# Measured 2026-09-20 (M1, smoke test window): pinning the maximum does not move the
# footprint. At the default (80% of RAM), at 64MB and at 24MB the MALLOC_SMALL region is
# 14MB in all three runs, because the Serial GC's adaptive policy already sizes the heap to
# the live set rather than to the maximum. The Java heap is the 2.5MB untagged VM_ALLOCATE
# region, not the 14MB of MALLOC_SMALL, which is Skia's native allocation.
#
# The cap stays because it bounds the worst case rather than the steady state: without it a
# runaway allocation may grow to gigabytes before the collector reacts. 64MB is many times
# the live set, so collections stay in the young generation and do not lengthen frames
# (the budget is one 120Hz frame, 8.33ms). Do not lower it to buy footprint; it does not buy any.

# Graphics memory is the largest block of the footprint and Skiko has the knob for it, so
# the image is built to let that knob be turned.
#
# Measured 2026-09-23 on an empty window: graphics and the window surface are 4.9MB at
# 400x300, 22.1MB at 800x600 and 53.8MB at 1600x1200, which is the surface scaling with the
# window and nothing else. At 800x600 on a 2x display one buffer is 7.7MB, so 22MB is three
# of them. `skiko.buffering=DOUBLE` takes the Metal drawable count from three to two.
#
# The property could not be set. Skiko reads it through System.getProperty, and
# `SkikoProperties` is a Kotlin object whose initialiser runs while the image is built, so
# it captures the build machine's properties and a value written at startup arrives too
# late. Passing `-D` to native-image does not help either: that sets the property for the
# build JVM, and a shared library has no command line to carry one into the image.
#
# Initialising that one class at run time is the fix. Its initialiser then runs in the
# process that is going to draw, and reads what RuntimeLayout.kt set moments earlier
# alongside skiko.library.path, which has always worked for exactly this reason.
#
# Not `--initialize-at-build-time` for it, which is what a previous note proposed: that
# freezes the whole System.getProperties() table into the artifact, including the build
# machine's java.home and user.home.
