# Unlike Darwin, upstream GraalVM supports Linux AWT. Its Native Image feature registers
# awt_xawt and writes the dynamic AWT libraries and libjava/libjvm shims beside the image.
# Do not force-load libawt_xawt.a and do not add the macOS placeholder or JNI_OnLoad_osxui.
#
# The JNI half of that support still has to be asked for. Staging the libraries only decides
# which ones load; it does not put any class in the image's JNI tables, and libawt's
# JNI_OnLoad starts by resolving java/awt/GraphicsEnvironment with FindClass to decide
# between the headless and the X11 toolkit. Without a registration that FindClass returns
# null and the process dies with NoClassDefFoundError on a class the JDK plainly has, inside
# Toolkit.loadLibraries, before any window exists. See the preserve flag below.

# Why the C shim is not handed to native-image here, the way build-native.sh does on macOS.
#
# When Native Image links a shared library on Linux it always writes its own linker version
# script and passes it as -Wl,--version-script=<file>. That script lists the image's own
# @CEntryPoint symbols under "global:" and ends with "local: *;", so any symbol that Native
# Image did not generate itself becomes local no matter how it got into the link, and the
# -Wl,-x that follows drops local entries from the symbol table altogether. That is why the
# shim's two functions were missing from even the full symbol table, and why neither
# --export-dynamic-symbol nor -u brought them back: a version script's "local: *" cannot be
# overridden by another command-line flag, and GNU ld refuses a second --version-script when
# the first one is anonymous, which the generated one is. The version script is written in
# CCLinkerInvocation.java in the GraalVM sources (the shared-library branch that produces
# exported_symbols.list); the second-script refusal is binutils' "anonymous version tag
# cannot be combined with other version tags".
#
# So Native Image builds the image under its own name and this script performs the final
# link itself. Nothing below depends on how native-image forwards linker arguments: the shim
# object and the image library sit on a plain cc command whose output is the library the Host
# loads. macOS keeps using -H:NativeLinkerOption, where -exported_symbol does work.
image_name="${LIBRARY_NAME}_image"

# The Host's dioxus_compose_host_* functions remain unresolved until the application loads
# the renderer. $ORIGIN lets GraalVM's generated shims and AWT libraries find the
# renderer and one another in the staged lib directory. The soname keeps the wrapper's
# DT_NEEDED entry a bare file name, so the staged directory stays relocatable.
#
# -H:Preserve=module=java.desktop is how the AWT classes reach the image's reflection and JNI
# tables. It is what GraalVM itself passes to build its own non-headless java.desktop
# integration test, which is the only AWT image upstream runs on Linux, and it is documented
# as removing the need to write reachability metadata for what it covers. The alternative
# would be a hand-written list of the X11 toolkit classes that libawt_xawt calls back into,
# and nobody here can run Linux to find out where such a list stops. It costs build time and
# image size, which is what -Os above is for, and the Linux job prints the staged size.
#
# The Compose, Skiko and Skia registrations are not part of java.desktop. They come from
# desktop/resources/META-INF/native-image, which is on the classpath and is therefore read on
# every platform without a -H:ConfigurationFileDirectories argument.
