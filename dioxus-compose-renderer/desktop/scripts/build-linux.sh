#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Builds the renderer as a Kotlin/Native static library for Linux:
#
#   build/linux/<target>/
#     libdioxus_compose_renderer.a        the renderer (Compose, Skia, the interpreter, our code)
#     libdioxus_compose_renderer_api.h    the header Kotlin/Native generates for it
#
# The two symbols the Host calls are the same ones the desktop build exports, with the same
# names and the same signatures: dioxus_compose_renderer_run and
# dioxus_compose_renderer_request_frame. There is no isolate and therefore no C shim here;
# see staticlib/src/IosEntryPoints.kt, which both platforms share.
#
# What this is instead of: the native image the desktop script builds carries a Java
# runtime, and most of what a Linux distribution of it weighs is that runtime rather than
# anything drawn. It also carries AWT and its X11 toolkit, which is a second window system
# underneath the one the renderer opens.
#
# Compose publishes no Kotlin/Native target for this platform, so the modules it draws with
# are built from source and published locally first. `scripts/build-compose.sh --target
# linuxX64` does that, and this script says so rather than doing it, because it is a Gradle
# build of someone else's repository and belongs in its own step.
#
# Usage: build-linux.sh [--release]
