    # The exit status is deliberately not fatal here, and the reason is where the class

    # before main runs, so it is already in the log by the time anything opens a window.
    # This function is called by the native-image build for that one line, and opening a
    # Compose window to read it is a lot of machinery to stand on. A hosted macOS runner
    # killed one of these with SIGTRAP while nothing in the tree had changed for that
    # platform, and the build failed for want of a string it had already read.
    #
    # So a run that dies after printing is reported and accepted. A run that dies before
    # printing leaves the file empty and still fails below. Whether the renderer actually
    # works is not this function's question: the smoke test that runs the built image is,
    # and it runs either way.
