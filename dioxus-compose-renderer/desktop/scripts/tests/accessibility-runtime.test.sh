# Does the image survive what an assistive technology actually asks it? (SPEC NFR-8, §7)
#
# accessibility-link.test.sh checks that the role classes are in the binary. That is a
# necessary condition and not a sufficient one: with every symbol present and a full,
# healthy tree coming out of ax-dump, turning on VoiceOver or the Accessibility Keyboard
# still aborted the process, because AppKit answers accessibilityHitTest: and
# accessibilityFocusedUIElement by resolving java.awt.Window through JNI and that class
# was not registered. Walking the tree never calls either method, so the dump could not
# see the gap.
#
# This test attaches the way an assistive client does, asks for the focused element, and
# requires the process to still be alive afterwards.
#
# It needs the calling terminal to hold the Accessibility permission (System Settings >
# Privacy & Security > Accessibility). Without it the test skips rather than passing,
# because a run that cannot query anything proves nothing.
