.SYNOPSIS
Measures what a dioxus-compose application costs in memory on Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
The companion to measure-memory.sh, which does the same on macOS. The two do not print the
same metric, because the two systems do not have the same one, and pretending otherwise
would invite a comparison that means nothing.

macOS is measured by physical footprint. The nearest thing here is the PRIVATE WORKING SET:
the pages this process has in RAM that no other process shares. It is what Task Manager's
"Memory" column shows, so a number from this script is a number you can see in Task Manager.
Working set and commit are printed beside it because they answer different questions, and
because a gap between them is itself a finding.

The window's size is reported with every sample. The window surface scales with its area,
so a measurement that does not say how big the window was cannot be compared with anything.
On macOS this caught a run where the window never reached the size it was asked for and the
number was 40MB out.

.PARAMETER Exe
The application to measure. A sample from a release works, and so does
target\release\examples\memory_probe.exe, which takes DXC_PROBE_WIDTH, DXC_PROBE_HEIGHT and
DXC_PROBE_ROWS and is the one that isolates what the window costs from what the content
costs.

.PARAMETER Width
.PARAMETER Height
Passed to the probe. Ignored by an application that sets its own window size.

.PARAMETER Rows
How many rows of six buttons the probe draws. 0 is an empty window.

.PARAMETER Settle
Seconds to wait before the first sample. The renderer finishes starting and the first frame
lands well before this; shorter measurements have come out low.

.PARAMETER Samples
How many samples to take. The median is reported, because one sample lands anywhere.

.EXAMPLE
.\measure-memory.ps1 -Exe .\target\release\examples\memory_probe.exe -Width 800 -Height 600 -Rows 0

.\measure-memory.ps1 -Exe .\sample-todo.exe
