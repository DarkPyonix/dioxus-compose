/**
 * What the window does when there is no display server to open one on.
 *
 * The only thing about the window itself that can be asserted where no X server is running, which
 * is every continuous integration machine and most of the machines this is developed on. It is
 * worth asserting because the alternative behaviours are both bad and both have happened to
 * windowing code: a throw that unwinds into the C entry point, which is undefined, and a process
 * that carries on with a null display and dies at the first call that dereferences it.
 *
 * Everything else about this window needs a screen and a hand: whether the drawing arrives with
 * the moved edge is a fact about what a compositor showed. `ResizeSyncTest` and
 * `WindowEventLogTest` on the JVM cover the two ways the code can get that wrong.

     * A window opens where there is a display server to open it on.

     * The other test here is about the machine that has none. This is about the one that has,
     * and what it covers is everything `open` does before a frame is ever asked for: choosing a
     * visual with a depth buffer, making a colormap for it, creating the window, and making a
     * GLX context current on it. Every one of those can fail against a real server and none of
     * them can fail without one, which is why this could not be written until there was a Linux
     * to run it on.
     *
     * Skipped where there is no display. The machine that has one answers this; the machine that
     * has none is answered by the test below.
