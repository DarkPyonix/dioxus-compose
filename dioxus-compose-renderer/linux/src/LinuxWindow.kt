/**
 * A window of this renderer's own on X11, drawn into with Skia and with no toolkit in between.
 *
 * The pair of `MacosWindow`, and written the same way: the platform is called directly from
 * Kotlin rather than through C of ours. On this platform that is Xlib, GLX and the sync
 * extension, reached through `cinterop/x11.def`. XWayland takes the same connection, so this is
 * the window on a Wayland desktop as well until one of its own is written.
 *
 * The one thing it does that no toolkit window does, and the reason it exists: **the frame that
 * belongs to a resize is drawn from inside the handling of the resize.** The display server has
 * already moved the window's edge by the time the event arrives, and what is inside that edge
 * is whatever was last painted. A frame drawn on the next turn of the loop leaves a strip of
 * window that has been claimed and not painted, as wide as the speed of the hand times how late
 * the painting is. Measured on the other desktop where the same mistake was made: one screen
 * refresh late at every speed, which is 3 pixels for a slow drag and 350 for a flick.
 *
 * Drawing inside the resize is only half of it. The other half is [ResizeSync]: the window
 * manager holds the frame it was about to show until the counter says the drawing for the size
 * it asked about exists.
 *
 * Two rules follow from drawing inside an event, and both are their own tested class because
 * both have been broken here before. A second frame started on top of one already being drawn
 * is refused, which is [WindowFrames]. The display server is read in one place only, which is
 * [WindowEventLog]: a read reached from inside a read would take the rest of a drag out of the
 * queue while the turn handling one size change is still running.
