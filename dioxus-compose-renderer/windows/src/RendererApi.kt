/**
 * What the C entry points call. See `staticlib-windows/src/WindowsEntryPoints.kt` for the
 * symbols themselves and for why they live in a module of their own.
 *
 * The status codes are the desktop shim's codes (`desktop/c/renderer_entry.c`), so a Host
 * reads the same number for the same mistake on every platform.
 *
 * Windows has no main thread to insist on. A window may be created on any thread, and the
 * thread that creates it is the one its messages are delivered to, so this renderer opens
 * its window, reads its messages and draws its frames on the thread that called in. That is
 * also the thread the Host keeps its state on, which is what makes a lock unnecessary on
 * either side, and why `RUN_NOT_MAIN_THREAD` is a code this platform never returns.
