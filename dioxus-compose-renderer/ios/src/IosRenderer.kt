/**
 * Runs the renderer's Compose application. This is what `dioxus_compose_renderer_run`
 * calls.
 *
 * The desktop renderer opens a window and returns when the window closes. iOS has no such
 * moment: `UIApplicationMain` installs the run loop and never returns, and the system, not
 * the application, decides when the process ends. So on iOS `run` blocks for the lifetime of
 * the process. A Rust `main` that calls `dioxus_compose::launch(app)` gets the behaviour it
 * already expects on desktop, which is that nothing after the call runs while the UI is up.
 *
 * The screen is drawn entirely from the mutation batches the Host streams.

 * The minimum UIKit application: one window whose root view controller is Compose.

 * call `DioxusContent` from its own `ComposeUIViewController`, but that is not the M5 path.
