//! The rules the build script acquires the renderer by, exercised directly.
//!
//! `build/renderer_dir.rs` is included from `build.rs`, and a build script is never
//! compiled for test, so anything asserted inside it is asserted nowhere. Including the
//! same file here is what gives it coverage.
//!
//! Nothing here touches the network. The module takes its downloader as a closure for
//! exactly that reason, so every branch of the search order, including the one that
//! downloads, runs from a temporary directory in a few milliseconds.
