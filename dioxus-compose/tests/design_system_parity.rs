//! The three ported systems, as the Host holds them and as the standalone project does.
//!
//! GNOME, Breeze and Deepin were worked out first in `dioxus-design-systems`, a project
//! that is published on its own and cannot depend on anything here, and their values were
//! then copied into `tokens.rs` so applications could select them. Two copies of the same
//! palette with nothing comparing them is exactly the arrangement that drifts: GNOME's
//! dark second accent carried white ink in one file and near black in the other, and
//! Breeze filled a dark panel with two different greys, for long enough that both were
//! described in comments as the value the other one held.
//!
//! So the copies are compared here, by reading the Kotlin sources as text. It is a blunt
//! instrument, and it only reaches the three systems whose tables are written as literals
//! (Material 3, Cupertino and Fluent derive theirs from palette objects), but it is the
//! only thing that can see both sides at once, and those three are the ones that were
//! copied by hand.
