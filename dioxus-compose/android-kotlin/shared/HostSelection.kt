 * scrolls sideways, and copying a selection that spans several of them puts a line break
 * between each, which is what Compose does when it gathers the selected text. The copy
 * shortcut, the context menu and the clipboard are the platform's, through Compose's
 * platform text handling, so nothing here reaches the Host: no event is sent while text
 * is selected or when it is copied, and the copied text never crosses the boundary.
 *
 * Text outside a region is not selectable, because nothing outside one is wrapped in this.
