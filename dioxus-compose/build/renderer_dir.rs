// Adding `dioxus-compose` to Cargo.toml is meant to be the whole setup: no variable to
// export, no file to download by hand, no script to run. `cargo build` gets the renderer.
// This file holds every rule that goes into that and every message it can fail with.
//
// It is `include!`d by `build.rs` and by `tests/renderer_resolution.rs`, so the rules a
// consumer hits at build time are the rules the tests exercise. It touches the filesystem
// and nothing else: the network is a closure the caller supplies, which is what lets the
// tests run the whole search order offline. No Cargo directives and no process exit
// either. The caller decides what to do with an error.
