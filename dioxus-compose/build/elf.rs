// Reading and setting an ELF shared object's SONAME.
//
// On Linux a library's SONAME is what dependents record as their `DT_NEEDED` entry: every
// ELF linker (GNU ld, gold, lld, mold) copies it verbatim. When there is no SONAME, GNU ld
// records the name it found the library under instead, and for a library reached through
// `-l` and a search directory that is the bare file name, not the directory it was found
// in. ld's own source says so where it opens a dynamic library it found by searching
// (`ldelf_open_dynamic_archive` in ld/ldelf.c): a DT_SONAME is used if the file has one,
// and otherwise the entry is the file name stripped of the directory the search found it
// in. Cargo links the renderer exactly that way, `-ldioxus_compose_renderer` plus `-L`, so
// a renderer with no SONAME is recorded as `libdioxus_compose_renderer.so` and the loader
// then has to search for it on a path an application that merely depends on this crate
// does not have. CI saw exactly that: "error while loading shared libraries:
// libdioxus_compose_renderer.so: cannot open shared object file".
//
// A SONAME that is the library's absolute path is recorded as that path, and the dynamic
// loader treats a `DT_NEEDED` entry containing a slash as a pathname and opens it directly,
// with no search at all (the ld.so(8) manual page describes that rule). That is the same
// lookup an absolute install name buys on macOS, which is what `set_soname` is for.
//
// Setting one needs the new string in the dynamic string table, and that table is packed
// between other sections with no room to grow where it is. So the table is copied, with
// the new name appended, into the padding at the end of a loadable segment: the linker
// starts each segment on a fresh page, and on the published renderer the read-only segment
// that holds the string table ends about two kilobytes short of the next one. The segment is extended over the copy, `DT_STRTAB`,
// `DT_STRSZ` and the string table's section header are pointed at it, and `DT_SONAME` is
// either updated or written into one of the spare `DT_NULL` slots GNU ld leaves at the end
// of the dynamic array. Every offset into the old table means the same thing in the new
// one, because the new one starts with a byte-for-byte copy of the old. Nothing else in
// the file moves.
//
// That is what patchelf would do, done here because requiring a tool that most
// distributions do not install by default would put a manual step back into `cargo build`.
//
// It is `include!`d from `renderer_dir.rs`, so the build script and the tests read the
// same code.
