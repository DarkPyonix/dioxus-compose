## Unreleased

### The renderer is built for the platform where Compose publishes one

macOS no longer carries a Java runtime. Where Compose publishes a target of its own, the
renderer is compiled for the platform directly; where it does not, it stays a native image.
Nothing an application writes changes: the same C ABI, the same protocol bytes, the same
interpreter sources.

| | Before | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A calculator on macOS | 93.1 MB across four files | **28.95 MB in one** |
| What it holds while open | 56 MB | **39 MB** |
| Threads | 22 | 10 |

For comparison, Apple's own Calculator holds 45 MB, and its heap is more than twice ours.

Linux and Windows keep the native image, and are lighter for a second reason: the toolkit
has been taken out of what the image is asked to keep. Nine ways of removing it were
measured; the six that worked are in the build, and the four that were worth nothing are
written down, because their failing is what found the cause.

`docs/platforms.md` has the measurements, what each platform can and cannot do, and why.

### Still missing on the macOS native path

Mouse input does not reach the scene. The keyboard does. Drawing, the accessibility tree,
the title bar and the window the application asked for are all in place.

## v0.0.0

The first published version. It is numbered 0.0.0 because the approach is proven and the
product is not: you can write a real application in Rust and watch it run, and you will
also run out of widgets partway through.

### What works, and was verified by running it

- **Declarative UI in Rust, drawn by Compose.** `rsx!`, hooks and signals on the Rust
  side; an AOT-compiled Compose Multiplatform renderer draws the pixels. No webview and
  no bundled JVM.
- **Korean IME.** Composition display, jamo-level backspace, arrow keys committing before
  moving, insertion mid-sentence and font fallback, all checked by hand on the macOS
  native image. This was the question the project existed to answer.
- **Accessibility.** VoiceOver reads the tree on the native image.
- **One boundary across two runtimes.** The desktop C smoke host links against the iOS
  static archive unmodified and produces the same handshake, byte for byte.
- **Four sample applications** that run: a calculator, a notepad, a task list over five
  thousand items, and a chat interface whose reply streams in from a worker thread.
- **Memory.** 60MB physical footprint for a running sample on macOS. The number most tools
  show is around 128MB, which counts shared read-only library pages that every other
  application on the machine is also counting.

### What is in the box

Twenty-three of the twenty-nine core widgets, custom drawing, pointer gestures, asset
delivery, six design systems behind one role-based contract, and a modern window that
draws its own title bar and follows the system colour scheme.

### What is not

- Six widgets are missing their renderer half: Checkbox, RadioButton, Switch, Slider,
  ProgressIndicator and Divider.
- Windows and Linux have never been run. The build scripts exist and CI now exercises
  them, which is how their first real bugs were found; neither has drawn a window yet.
- Android and web are designed and unimplemented.
- The design system contract does not yet cover pickers or selection controls, so those
  widgets cannot express what each system does differently.
- The samples work and do not yet look like applications, because until this version an
  application could not write a padding or a background from `rsx!`.

### Installing

The crate builds without a renderer, which is what a plain `cargo add` gets you: enough to
compile against, not enough to draw. Drawing needs the `native-renderer` feature and a
renderer built for your platform, which for now means building it yourself from this
repository. Release artifacts come later.
