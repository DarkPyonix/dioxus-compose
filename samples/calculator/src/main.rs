//! A working desktop calculator, clone coded from the Windows, macOS and Deepin ones, with
//! the tape every desk calculator that had a printer used to have.
//!
//! The three references are one declaration under three design systems. What they share is
//! the shape: the number at the foot of a reading area, a row of memory keys, and four
//! columns of keys along the bottom.
//!
//! Written the way an application using this library would be written: `rsx!` and hooks,
//! no Kotlin and no protocol types.
//!
//! There is no keyboard entry, and the reason is worth saying out loud because it used to
//! be here. Only Enter can cross the boundary as a key, so digits had to be read out of a
//! focused text field by comparing what it held before against what it holds now. That
//! works, and it needs a field on the screen to hold the focus: a line of development
//! scaffolding sitting under the keypad, doing nothing a calculator does. A keypad is
//! pressed. When the protocol can name the keys, typing comes back as typing.
