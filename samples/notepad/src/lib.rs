//! A working text editor, clone coded from the iOS and Windows memo applications.
//!
//! Written the way an application using this library would be written: `rsx!` and hooks,
//! no Kotlin and no protocol types. Reading and writing files happens on a worker thread
//! and comes back as a signal update, so the UI thread never waits on a disk.
//!
//! Several documents can be open at once. The one being written lives in the signals the
//! editor reads, and the rest wait on a shelf, so choosing a document is a swap rather
//! than a different code path through the whole screen. The list of them stands beside the
//! page on a desktop window and arrives in a sheet on anything narrower.
