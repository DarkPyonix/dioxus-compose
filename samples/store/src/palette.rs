//! The colours the shop is drawn in.
//!
//! Literals rather than roles, and that is the whole point of this file. The shop is one
//! reference picture: a white page, near black ink, flat light grey cards and a single
//! yellow. A role would be resolved by whichever design system is running, so the yellow
//! came out as that system's accent (blue, every time) and the cards came out of the
//! accent containers as pale lilac and powder blue. None of those colours is anywhere in
//! the picture this shop is meant to be.
//!
//! They live here rather than beside the widgets that use them so that the shop has one
//! place to change. A hex scattered through the tree is a hex somebody misses.
