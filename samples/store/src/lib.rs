//! A clothing shop: a catalogue you can browse by category, a product you can size and
//! count, and a bag that adds up.
//!
//! Unified rather than adaptive, and the stronger sense of the word: the reference is one
//! picture of one design, so the shop draws that picture everywhere rather than the
//! platform's version of it. `THEME` names the design system and the colour scheme, and
//! `palette` names the colours, because the picture has a yellow accent and flat grey
//! cards that no design system's palette would have given it.
//!
//! The garments are drawn, not photographed. A photograph of a real garment belongs to
//! whoever took it, so the shop's stock is a set of original vector drawings in
//! `assets/`, registered once with `asset` and drawn by id after that.
