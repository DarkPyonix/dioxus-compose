//! A podcast hub: new episodes, an episode you can open, and a player.
//!
//! Covers are pictures: a podcast cover is a poster, made to be recognised at the size of
//! a thumbnail, and a draw list cannot say one. Each of the three is an original drawing
//! registered once and drawn by id after that.
//!
//! The drawing this sample is about is the waveform. Every design system's player has one,
//! nothing in the widget vocabulary is one, and it is the clearest case of a `Canvas`
//! earning its place: forty columns, the played part in the accent and the rest in grey,
//! built once into an attribute that only crosses the boundary when it changes.
//!
//! Unified rather than adaptive, and the stronger sense of the word: the reference is one
//! picture of one design, so the hub draws that picture everywhere rather than the
//! platform's version of it. `THEME` names the design system and the colour scheme, and
//! `palette` names the colours, because the picture has a single orange accent that no
//! design system's palette would have given it.
