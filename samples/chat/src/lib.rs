//! An LLM chat interface with no network, clone coded from Google Gemini.
//!
//! Conversations down the side, a scrollback of messages, a composer where Enter sends and
//! Shift+Enter starts a new line, and an assistant whose reply arrives a few characters at
//! a time from a worker thread while the user keeps scrolling and typing.
//!
//! The conversations are a destination set rather than a list this code lays out, so the
//! Renderer draws them as a bar along the bottom of a phone, a rail beside a tablet and the
//! reference's sidebar on a desktop, from one declaration.
//!
//! The scrollback is a `LazyColumn` so a long conversation costs widgets in proportion to
//! what is on screen. Each message carries an id that never changes and that id is its key,
//! so the message growing at the bottom does not disturb the ones above it.
