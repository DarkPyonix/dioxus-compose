//! A task list: add, edit in place, complete, delete, reorder, filter, and survive a
//! restart.
//!
//! The list is drawn with `LazyColumn`, so the number of widgets that exist is
//! proportional to what is on screen rather than to the number of tasks. Filling it with
//! five thousand rows is how that claim becomes something a person can check, and the
//! button that does it lives behind "About this sample" rather than on the list: a task
//! list does not have a button that invents five thousand tasks, and putting one on the
//! main surface says this is a demonstration of a list rather than a list.
//!
//! Every task carries an id that never changes, and that id is the list key. Editing one
//! row therefore rebuilds that row and leaves its neighbours alone.
