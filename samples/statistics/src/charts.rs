//! The two drawings: a dial and a week of bars.
//!
//! Both are `DrawList`s rather than widgets, because a chart is pixels the widget
//! vocabulary has no name for.
//!
//! The colours are this sample's own rather than the design system's. The reference these
//! charts are drawn from names a sage panel, a black column and an orange marker, and a
//! role cannot say any of the three: whatever system is active would answer with its own
//! accent instead. So the charts read the sample's palette, and the test below holds them
//! to it, which is the guarantee a role was giving before.
//!
//! `dial` still takes its two inks as arguments. A dial sitting on the page and the same
//! dial sitting on a tinted panel need different ink, and which panel it is on is
//! something only the screen knows.
