//! Product statistics: a dial, a week of costs, and where the money went.
//!
//! This is the sample that pushes on `Canvas`. A dial with a tick ring and a marker, and a
//! bar chart with a day under each column, are pixels the widget vocabulary has no name
//! for, and they are the two most common things a statistics screen is made of. Both are
//! draw lists, and every colour in them is a role, so they follow the reader into dark and
//! come out in each design system's own accent.
//!
//! Unified, naming Cupertino and light: the reference is a light iOS design, and a
//! design that flips to dark on a machine set that way is not the design being compared
//! against. `THEME` says both.
