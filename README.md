**Declarative UI in Rust, rendered by an AOT-compiled Compose Multiplatform engine.**

*Native desktop UI in Rust with no webview and no bundled JVM.*

```rust
rsx! {
    Column {
        fill_max_width: true,
        Text { text: "dioxus-compose chat" }
        Button { text: "Send", on_click: move |_| send() }
    }
}
```

You author components with `rsx!`, hooks and signals. `dioxus-core`'s VirtualDom turns them into
mutations, a narrow C ABI carries those mutations across the boundary, and a Kotlin/Compose
interpreter materialises them as a real Compose tree, with Compose's text layout, its widgets, and
its platform IME.

## 🎯 Why this exists

Two problems meet here.

**Web-stack desktop apps are heavy.** For an application that stays open all day, the memory
footprint and the download size are the problem, not responsiveness. Embedding a browser, or
shipping a JVM alongside your app, costs tens to hundreds of megabytes before your own code runs.

**Rust has no toolkit with Compose-grade text.** The Rust GUI ecosystem renders well, but text
shaping, selection, accessibility and above all **IME** are not at the level Compose reached years
ago. For an app where typing *is* the interface, an IME that works 90% of the time is an app that
does not work. Korean, Japanese and Chinese composition is not a nice-to-have.

dioxus-compose takes Compose's renderer without taking Compose's runtime cost: the Kotlin side is
compiled ahead of time into a native shared library (GraalVM native-image on desktop, Kotlin/Native
on iOS), so there is no JVM in the shipped artifact.

### Weight, roughly

All figures are **approximate**, taken from [`docs/INTENT.md`](docs/INTENT.md). They are
order-of-magnitude comparisons, not benchmarks.

| Approach | Approximate weight | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Webview stack (Electron, Tauri-class) | Heaviest: a browser engine per app or per system | Rejected by **C1**: memory and size |
| Compose + bundled JVM (jlink) | ~80–120 MB of JVM alone | Rejected by **C2**. AppCDS fixes startup, not size |
| Pure Rust toolkit (Iced-class) | ~10–20 MB | Rejected by **C5**: text and IME maturity |
| **dioxus-compose** | ~64 MB renderer + ~21 MB Skia | Larger than Iced, far smaller than a webview or JVM stack |

The target in `NFR-3` is **under 100 MB distribution size and under 100 MB RSS for an empty
window**. That requirement is still `Draft`: it gets confirmed by measurement at milestone M1.

### Non-negotiables

| ID | Constraint |
|---|---|
| **C1** | No webview: no WKWebView, WebView2, WebKitGTK, Tauri or wry |
| **C2** | No bundled JVM: the JVM is allowed only in the development shell |
| **C3** | No hand-written JNI or cinterop glue; boundary shims are generated |
| **C4** | UI is authored declaratively **in Rust**. Kotlin is a renderer implementation detail |
| **C5** | Compose-grade text, IME and widget quality, never bypassed |

---

## 🚦 Status

A **young project under active development**, built spec-first. It is not published to crates.io and
the API will change.

### Platforms

| Platform | State | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| 🍎 **macOS (arm64)** | **Works end to end** | Rust host → C ABI → native-image renderer → window on screen, verified 2026-09-20 on Liberica NIK 25 Full. Basic Korean IME input works; the full IME checklist (`SPEC §6`) is not finished |
| 🪟 Windows desktop | Not scripted | A target in `NFR-4`, but `build-native.sh` refuses to run outside macOS today |
| 🐧 Linux desktop | Not scripted | Same. The **Rust workspace and the JVM dev shell do work** on Linux: CI runs the Rust gate on `ubuntu-latest` |
| 📱 iOS | Designed, not implemented | Kotlin/Native `-produce static` with `@CName` symbols (milestone M5) |
| 🤖 Android | Builds, not yet run | A Kotlin Activity owns the process and the loop, Rust is a cdylib, and the JNI shims on both sides are generated from the schema. The app and the library both build for `arm64-v8a`; nothing has run on a device or an emulator yet, which is what `PR-5` asks for (milestone M6) |
| 🌐 Web (wasm) | Designed, feasibility open | Rust wasm ↔ Kotlin/Wasm linked directly, no JS bridge, `PR-6` (milestone M7, open question **Q3**) |

### The two halves

The Rust **Host** is well ahead of the Kotlin **Renderer**. The Compose interpreter is the piece
being finished right now, so several requirements pass on the Host side while the Renderer half is
still landing.

| Capability | Host (Rust) | Renderer (Kotlin) |
|---|---|---|
| Node tree mutations: `FR-1` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Schema-driven rendering: `FR-2` | ✅ | ✅ `Column` `Row` `Box` `Text` `TextField` `Button` `Spacer` `LazyColumn` |
| Synchronous event dispatch: `FR-3`, `FR-12` | ✅ | ✅ key consumption wired to `Modifier.onKeyEvent` |
| Uncontrolled `TextField`, IME ownership: `D5` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Schema codegen in lockstep: `FR-7` | ✅ | ✅ generated `Protocol.gen.kt` |
| `LazyColumn` windowing: `FR-8` | ✅ the Host materialises only the requested range | ⚠️ **renders as a plain `Column` for now**: the windowing half is an open `TODO(FR-8)` |
| Streaming text `AppendText`: `FR-9` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Modifiers: `FR-10` | ✅ `Padding` `FillMaxWidth/Height` `Width` `Height` `Size` `Background` `Clickable` | ✅ all of the above |
| Design primitives and design systems: `FR-13`, `FR-14` | ❌ `Draft`: **specified only, no code yet** | ❌ |
| Third-party widget extension: `FR-11` | ❌ `Draft`: options under evaluation (**Q2**) | ❌ |

Milestones live in [`PROJECT.md`](PROJECT.md) (M0–M8). **M1 decides the project**: if Korean IME
composition holds up in a native-image build, the rest is volume of work.

## ✨ A taste of the API

The snippet below is the real
[`dioxus-compose/examples/desktop_demo.rs`](dioxus-compose/examples/desktop_demo.rs), trimmed for
length. It compiles in this repository.

```rust
use dioxus_compose::prelude::*;

fn app() -> Element {
    let mut messages = use_signal(Vec::<String>::new);
    let mut draft = use_signal(String::new);

    rsx! {
        Column {
            fill_max_width: true,
            Text { text: "dioxus-compose chat" }
            for message in messages() {
                Text { text: message }
            }
            TextField {
                placeholder: "Write a message",
                multiline: true,
                on_value_change: move |value| draft.set(value),
                on_key_down: move |event: KeyEvent| {
                    if event.key() == Key::Enter && !event.shift_key() {
                        let message = draft().trim().to_owned();
                        if !message.is_empty() {
                            messages.write().push(message);
                            draft.set(String::new());
                        }
                        event.consume();   // the Renderer's onKeyEvent returns true
                    }
                }
            }
            Button {
                text: "Send",
                on_click: move |_| { /* ... */ }
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    dioxus_compose::launch(app);
}
```

Two details worth noticing:

- **`event.consume()`** is how a handler tells the Renderer it handled the key, the same idea as
  `preventDefault()` on the web, or `PointerInputChange.consume()` in Compose. Dioxus 0.7 handlers
  have no return value, so the flag rides back on the event object (`FR-12`).
- **Key events are not sent to Rust while an IME composition is in progress.** Enter during
  composition commits the composition; it does not submit. Getting this wrong is exactly how Korean
  input loses the syllable being typed.

> ⚠️ `dioxus_compose::Box` has to be written qualified inside `rsx!`, `dioxus-core` 0.7's macro
> expansion uses an unqualified `Box<T>`, which the prelude glob would shadow.

---

## 🎨 Design systems

The plan is three first-class design systems, **Material 3**, **Apple HIG** and **WinUI/Fluent** , 
chosen per application, either unified across every platform or adapted to the host platform:

```rust
// The same design system everywhere
LaunchBuilder::new().with_theme(Theme::unified(DesignSystem::Material3)).launch(app);

// Follow the host platform. The fallback argument is mandatory
LaunchBuilder::new().with_theme(Theme::adaptive(DesignSystem::Material3)).launch(app);
```

The design is worked out in detail in `FR-13` and `FR-14` of [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md):

- Widgets emit **roles**, never literals: `ColorRole`, `TypeRole`, `ShapeRole`, `SpaceRole`, and
  component variants such as `ButtonVariant::{Filled, Tonal, Outlined, Text}`.
- **The Renderer resolves roles into tokens**, not the Host. A dark-mode switch is then one
  `SetTheme` mutation plus a `CompositionLocal` invalidation, instead of an `O(nodes)` storm of
  `SetProp` calls charged against the frame budget.
- Adding a fourth design system must not touch widget code, properties, modifiers or the wire
  format: one Rust enum variant, one Kotlin token table, one rules implementation.
- `adaptive` is **not** the default. Without `with_theme` you get
  `Theme::unified(DesignSystem::Material3)`, because a default that looks different on every
  platform is a bad default.

> **Status: `Draft`, design only.** ⚠️ None of this exists in code yet. `Theme`, `DesignSystem`,
> `ColorRole`, `TypeRole` and `ScrollColumn` appear nowhere in `dioxus-compose/src/` or in the Kotlin
> renderer today. What ships now is the literal subset: `Modifier::Background(u32 ARGB)`,
> `Modifier::Padding(f32)` and friends. The snippet above is **illustrative of the specified API**,
> not of a working one.

```

**Rust describes the UI; Compose interprets it.** Rust never calls the Compose API directly, it
cannot. GraalVM's `@CEntryPoint` passes only primitives and word-sized values, so objects like
`Modifier` or `MutableState` can never cross. Instead the UI tree travels **as a value** and a
general-purpose interpreter on the Kotlin side rebuilds it. Cash App's Redwood and Jetpack Glance
use the same pattern.

**The boundary is synchronous and same-thread** (`PR-1`). The VirtualDom runs on the Renderer's UI
thread and the two sides call each other directly, the way JSI replaced React Native's old bridge.
There is no queue, no ring buffer and no thread hop, and an event handler can return a result within
the same call. Heavy work, I/O, network, PTY, runs on Host worker threads that update signals and
request a frame (`PR-3`); user code never touches a boundary function.

**Only primitives, pointers and lengths cross** (`PR-2`). Payloads are fixed-layout, zero-copy
records produced by codegen and read in place, no postcard, bincode or JSON on the hot path
(`PR-4`). Type safety is restored above that `bytes` boundary by generating the Kotlin types from a
single Rust source of truth, with a schema hash that fails the build when the two drift (`FR-7`,
`D6`).

**UI-local state stays in Kotlin** (`D5`). `TextField` is uncontrolled and composition text never
makes a round trip through Rust. Scroll position, focus and animation state belong to the Renderer
too.

<details>
<summary><b>Why macOS needs Liberica NIK, and three small shims</b></summary>

Compose Desktop's window is an AWT `JFrame`, and AOT compilation does not change which code path
runs, so the AWT IME path survives native-image (`D4`). But upstream GraalVM **skips AWT entirely
on Darwin** ([oracle/graal#13272](https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/13272)), which means no
static AWT archive and no way to link the renderer. Liberica NIK Full links AWT statically.

Statically linked macOS AWT then looks for three things by file path at runtime, each met by a thin
shim in `dioxus-compose-renderer/desktop/c/`:

| Missing thing | Shim |
|---|---|
| `libawt_lwawt.dylib`, which libawt loads by path | A placeholder dylib; the JNI functions resolve inside the executable image |
| `libjawt.dylib`, which Skiko `dlopen`s from `<java.home>/lib` | A forwarder into the image's own `JAWT_GetAWT` |
| `JNI_OnLoad_osxui`, required of a statically linked JNI library and absent from NIK's archive | Defined directly |

Also: **AppKit demands the main thread.** The renderer runs on a secondary thread while the main
thread creates and runs `NSApplication` itself, putting AWT into embedded mode, the same mode SWT
and JavaFX hosts use. Letting AWT own the loop re-enters `[NSApp run]` forever, and control never
returns to the Host after the window closes.

The JNI mentioned here is entirely internal to the JDK. The Host ↔ Renderer boundary is pure C ABI.

## 🚀 Getting started

### Using it in your own project

One line. `cargo build` works out which renderer this target needs, downloads the release
artifact for the crate's exact version, checks it against the published `.sha256`, unpacks it
into a cache outside `target/`, and links it.

```toml
[dependencies]
dioxus-compose = "0.0.0"
```

There is no environment variable to set, no artifact to fetch by hand and no script to run. The
cache is keyed by version and target, so it survives `cargo clean` and is shared between projects
on the machine.

Two variables exist for the cases that need them, and neither is part of installing:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `DIOXUS_COMPOSE_RENDERER_DIR` | Use the renderer in this directory. Checked first, and nothing is downloaded when it is set, so a renderer you built yourself, a vendored copy or an air-gapped build all work through it. |
| `DIOXUS_COMPOSE_CACHE_DIR` | Move the cache off `$HOME/.cache/dioxus-compose` (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\dioxus-compose` on Windows). |

A build with no network says which two files to put where, and putting them there is all it takes.
`default-features = false` builds with no renderer at all, for a headless or documentation build;
running a binary built that way prints what is missing and exits non-zero rather than opening no
window and returning 0.

Everything below this point is about working on **this repository**, which needs the renderer
toolchain as well.

### 0. Check your machine

```bash
./scripts/setup-check.sh          # --quiet for CI-style output
```

This verifies every tool the build needs and prints the exact fix for anything missing. Start here;
everything below assumes it passes.

### 1. Rust

Install through [rustup](https://rustup.rs). `scripts/check.sh` runs `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`,
so both components are required. The workspace targets Rust **1.85+** (edition 2024).

```bash
rustup component add rustfmt clippy
```

### 2. Liberica NIK 25 **Full**, only for the native renderer build

> ⚠️ **Upstream GraalVM does not work on macOS.** It skips AWT support on Darwin
> ([oracle/graal#13272](https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/13272), still open as of 2026-09), so
> Compose Desktop cannot be linked into the image. Use BellSoft **Liberica NIK 25 Full**, the
> *Full* variant, not the standard one.

```bash
brew install --cask liberica-nik-full
# or download "NIK 25 Full" from https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/native-image-kit/
# or, scripted and version-pinned (macOS only):
./scripts/install-nik.sh
```

`dioxus-compose-renderer/desktop/scripts/env.sh` discovers it in this order:

1. `$GRAALVM_HOME`, if set
2. the newest match of
   `~/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/bellsoft-liberica-vm-full-openjdk25*/Contents/Home`

Development uses `bellsoft-liberica-vm-full-openjdk25-25.0.4.1`. The scripts **reject** any install
without `lib/static/darwin-*/libawt_lwawt.a`. That catches plain GraalVM up front, instead of after
a long build ends in a link failure.

macOS also needs the Xcode command line tools (`xcode-select --install`) for `cc`, `ld` and the
AppKit headers used by `dioxus-compose-renderer/desktop/c/`.

**The scripts support macOS only today.** Linux and Windows native-image builds are not scripted.

### 3. Kotlin

Nothing to install. `dioxus-compose-renderer/kotlin` (`kotlin.bat` on Windows) is a
self-bootstrapping wrapper that downloads the pinned toolchain on first use.

### 4. Build the renderer

Produces the renderer, Skia and the `libjawt` / `libawt_lwawt` helpers in
`dioxus-compose-renderer/build/native-image/dist/lib/` (`PR-8`). Takes several minutes.

```bash
cd dioxus-compose-renderer
./desktop/scripts/build-native.sh
```

<details>
<summary><b>What lands in <code>dist/lib/</code></b></summary>

```
build/native-image/dist/lib/
  libdioxus_compose_renderer.dylib   the renderer (AWT, Skiko JNI, Compose, our code)
  libskiko-macos-<arch>.dylib        Skia, loaded by Skiko by path
  libjawt.dylib                      forwards JAWT_GetAWT into the renderer
  libawt_lwawt.dylib                 placeholder that libawt loads by path
```
</details>

### 5. Smoke-test it

Links a minimal C host against the library and calls `dioxus_compose_renderer_run`. A window should
open, and closing it should return 0, the `PR-8` acceptance criterion.

```bash
cd dioxus-compose-renderer
./desktop/scripts/smoke-test.sh
```

For an unattended run, set `DIOXUS_COMPOSE_AUTOEXIT_MS=6000` to make the window close itself.

### 6. Run the Rust demo

```bash
cargo run -p dioxus-compose --example desktop_demo --features native-renderer
```

In a checkout of this repository the build script prefers the renderer you just built, at
`dioxus-compose-renderer/build/native-image/dist/lib`, over anything it could download. The full
order is `DIOXUS_COMPOSE_RENDERER_DIR`, then that workspace build, then the cache, then the release
for the crate's version (`NFR-10`).

### 7. The JVM dev shell

The fastest loop when you are working on the renderer itself: hot reload and `@Preview` work, and no
native-image build is needed (`NFR-5`, `D7`).

```bash
cd dioxus-compose-renderer
./kotlin run -m desktop   # the Compose development shell
./kotlin run -m desktop    # the renderer module itself on the JVM, driven by a scripted Host
```

> The JVM is permitted **only here**. Shipped artifacts never contain one (`C2`).

---

## 📊 Performance

The goal (`NFR-9`) is to be **indistinguishable from the same screen written by hand in
Kotlin/Compose**. The reference is a 120 Hz display: 8.33 ms per frame.

### Budgets, `SPEC §5.1`

| Item | Budget (p99, release build) |
|---|---|
| Overhead versus a pure-Compose baseline | ≤ 10% frame time |
| Host work (handler + diff + batch encode) | ≤ 0.5 ms normal interaction, ≤ 1 ms streaming frame |
| One boundary call | ≤ 100 ns desktop/iOS, ≤ 200 ns Android with `@FastNative` |
| Batch apply (decode + snapshot apply) | ≤ 0.3 ms per 100 mutations |
| Input → pixels | Same frame count as the baseline; zero extra frames of latency |
| Steady-state allocation | 0 in boundary encoding (arena reuse); ≤ 200 per frame across the Host path, and not growing |
| Dropped frames | 0 while streaming at 100 appends/s and scrolling a 10,000-item list |

Budget regressions are treated as bugs, and CI fails the build on them.

### Measured, 2026-09-20

Recorded in [`dioxus-compose/benches/baseline.json`](dioxus-compose/benches/baseline.json) and
re-run by `cargo bench` inside `scripts/check.sh`.

> **Machine:** Mac mini (Macmini9,1) · Apple M1, 8 cores (4 performance + 4 efficiency) · 16 GiB ·
> macOS 26.5.1 (25F80) · `aarch64-apple-darwin` · rustc 1.98.1 · release profile.

| Measurement | Result | Budget |
|---|---|---|
| Click → dispatch → diff → encode | **13.3 µs** p99 | ≤ 500 µs |
| Encode 100 mutations | **2.9 µs** p99, **0** steady-state allocations | ≤ 0.3 ms |
| Streaming: 100 appends into a 10,000-message conversation | **220 µs** p99 | ≤ 1 ms |
| Allocations per interaction, whole Host path | **99** | ≤ 200, and must not grow |

Those 99 allocations are Dioxus's own, inside diffing and event handling. Driving them to zero would
mean forking Dioxus, which contradicts `D2`; Rust has no GC, so they do not turn into frame pauses.
The criterion is that the number **does not grow** across repeated identical interactions, growth is
treated as a leak or a dead cache and investigated.

These are **Host-side numbers**. Renderer-side frame timing, and the 10%-versus-baseline comparison,
still have to be measured on the native-image build.

## 🤝 Contributing

### Spec Driven Development

**The SPEC is the source of truth.** Before implementing a behaviour, find its SPEC ID (`FR-*`,
`NFR-*`, `PR-*`). If none exists, amend the SPEC first, in its own commit. If code and SPEC disagree,
the code is wrong, unless the SPEC is, in which case fix the SPEC first and explain why. Decisions
change in [`docs/INTENT.md`](docs/INTENT.md) first, then SPEC, then code.

### Test Driven Development

SDD says what to build; TDD is how it gets built. Tests come from acceptance criteria, so **a
requirement with no test is not done**.

- Red, green, refactor. Test and implementation land in the **same commit**, the tree builds green
  at every commit.
- Name tests after the requirement: `fr4_set_prop_does_not_recompose_siblings`,
  `pr2_batch_applies_atomically`.
- A bug fix starts with a test that reproduces the bug.
- Test through the public surface: the crate API and the C exports; the interpreter and
  `HostConnection`.
- Use the checked-in protocol vectors and `FakeHostConnection`, not mocks of our own protocol.
- Performance is a test too: §5.1 is a benchmark suite, and the allocation ceiling is an assertion.

IME (`§6`) and accessibility (`§7`) are manual checklists run on the **native-image build**, and the
SPEC says so explicitly rather than leaving them silently untested.

### The quality gate

```bash
./scripts/check.sh              # fmt, clippy, tests, quick benchmarks, Kotlin build and tests
./scripts/check.sh --full       # the same, with the full benchmark sample
./scripts/check.sh --no-kotlin  # Rust only (DXC_SKIP_KOTLIN=1 does the same)
```

CI mirrors that split. [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs the Rust gate on macOS and Linux for
every push and pull request, while [`native-renderer.yml`](.github/workflows/native-renderer.yml)
builds the native-image renderer and runs the C smoke test on pushes to `main`/`develop`, nightly,
and on demand, that build needs a ~1 GB NIK download and tens of minutes, which is too slow to put
in front of every push (`NFR-5`, `D7`).

### Commits

One logical change per commit; do not mix SPEC edits, refactors and features. Subject format:

```
<Type>: <imperative summary>
```

`Feat` · `Fix` · `Refactor` · `Docs` · `Test` · `Chore`. Reference SPEC IDs where relevant, for
example `Feat: Return handler result from dispatch_event (PR-2)`. Do **not** add `Co-Authored-By`
trailers or any AI attribution.
