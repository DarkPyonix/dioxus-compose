# The Linux renderer library an application links names every Host function the renderer
# calls, so that the application exports them.
#
# The renderer image finds dioxus_compose_host_* in the executable by name. A Rust
# executable exports nothing it was not asked to, and the Host crate has no way to ask on
# an application's behalf: a build script's link arguments reach that package's own
# binaries and stop. So the asking is done by libdioxus_compose_renderer.so, which every
# application links: it leaves those functions undefined, and a linker exports from an
# executable whatever a shared library on its link line needs. A name missing from that
# list is a function the application does not export, and the renderer dies calling it
# with "undefined symbol" after the window has started to come up.
#
# Nothing here needs Linux. Three lists have to agree and all three are in the tree: what
# the C file references, what the Host defines, and what the renderer declares it calls.
# The Linux build checks the linked result against the image itself as well.
