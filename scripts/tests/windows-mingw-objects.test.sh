# The Windows renderer is a MinGW object linked by an MSVC-mode linker, and two MinGW
# conventions mean something else there. Left as they are, the link succeeds and the
# program is wrong: static constructors never run, so the Kotlin runtime starts without its
# globals and the first call hangs; and every function's unwind data is dropped, so a Kotlin
# exception that crosses two functions sends the unwinder into a loop. Both were seen.
#
# `dioxus-compose-renderer/scripts/fix-mingw-objects.py` rewrites the objects before the
# link. This runs it on small MinGW objects built the way Kotlin/Native builds its own
# (`fixtures/mingw-object.cpp` says how), in both COFF layouts: the ordinary one, and the
# "big object" one Kotlin/Native writes once an object has more sections than 16 bits can
# number, which the renderer's always has. Then it reads the result back and checks:
#
#   - no .ctors section is left, and the constructor is in .CRT$XCU, where the MSVC
#     runtime looks;
#   - every .pdata$NAME and .xdata$NAME is an associative COMDAT of the .text$NAME it
#     describes, which is what keeps an MSVC-mode linker from discarding it.
#
# It needs python3 and nothing else; no compiler, no Windows.
