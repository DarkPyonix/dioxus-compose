# The Kotlin gate builds and tests the whole project where X11 is installed, and names the
# platforms one by one where it is not. The risk in naming them is that a platform added
# later is left out silently and stops being built at all, so what is checked here is that
# the list the gate uses is the project's own list minus exactly the one that needs X11.
