# prompt is written fresh every time by whoever is dispatching the work, and that is the
# thing that keeps going wrong. A run was once told, in its own task prompt, to do the
# exact thing this file forbids: six of them built the renderer at once and took the
# machine down. A rule that depends on remembering to restate it is not a rule.
#
# There are three launchers and they must not drift apart. An agent started through the
# one that was missed is an agent that never heard the rule.
