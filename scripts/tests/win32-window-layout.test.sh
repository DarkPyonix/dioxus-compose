# The window the renderer opens for itself on Windows is five pointers, and the Kotlin
# side reads them by offset. Nothing in either language checks the other, so a field added
# to the C struct would leave Kotlin reading a pointer from the wrong place: a window
# handle used as a Direct3D device, which is a crash with no line in it to read.
#
# The event struct has a second job. One piece of Kotlin reads what either platform's
# window recorded, so the two C declarations have to stay the same as each other; a field
# added to one of them alone is a scroll delta read as a button state.
#
# Two checks, then. The first compares the two declarations and needs nothing but the
# files, so it runs wherever this is run. The second compiles the struct and asks C where
# each field is, then checks that the Kotlin side reads from there.
#
# That second check prefers MSVC, because Windows is the machine this describes. It will
# take any C compiler though, and on a machine with no Windows at all that is the point:
# every field here is an `int32_t`, a `float` or a pointer, whose sizes and alignments are
# the same on every 64-bit target this project builds for, so a compiler that has never
# seen a Windows header still answers correctly. With no compiler at all, it skips.
