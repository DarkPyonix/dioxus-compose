#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Usage: ./scripts/setup-worktrees.sh [--all] [--check]
#
# Gives every git worktree its own build directory, which means leaving Cargo's default
# alone and removing anything that overrides it.
#
#   (no flag)  fix this worktree
#   --all      fix every worktree of this repository
#   --check    look at every worktree, change nothing, exit non-zero if any of them
#              overrides the build directory
#
# Two checkouts must not build into one directory. Cargo leaves the package path out of
# the unit hash for a path package, so two checkouts holding identical sources become a
# single cache entry, and the binary that runs is whichever one compiled first. Everything
# fixed at compile time then comes from that checkout: env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"),
# include_str!, whatever a build script left in OUT_DIR, the absolute install name burned
# into the renderer. A run in the main checkout has already generated into an agent's
# worktree this way, and a sample built there came up with a black window because the
# binary had been compiled somewhere else.
#
# The saving that override bought was real: ten worktrees each with their own target/
# filled a 349GB volume to 100% once. So this reports what each worktree costs and how
# much room is left, because the answer to that incident is fewer worktrees and pruning
# them, not one build directory shared by checkouts that overwrite each other.
